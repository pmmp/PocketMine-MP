/**
 * Allows the use of custom Player classes. This enables overriding built-in Player methods to change behaviour that is
 * not possible to alter any other way.
 *
 * You probably don't need this event, and found your way here because you looked at some code in an old plugin that
 * abused it (very common). Instead of using custom player classes, you should consider making session classes instead.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/pmmp/SessionsDemo
 *
 * This event is a power-user feature, and multiple plugins using it at the same time will conflict and break unless
 * they've been designed to work together. This means that it's only usually useful in private plugins.
 *
 * WARNING: This should NOT be used for adding extra functions or properties. This is intended for **overriding existing
 * core behaviour**, and should only be used if you know EXACTLY what you're doing.
 * Custom player classes may break in any update without warning. This event isn't much more than glorified reflection.
