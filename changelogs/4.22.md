# 4.22.0
Released 7th June 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.0**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.0.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 4.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

# 4.22.1
Released 9th June 2023.

## Fixes
- Replaced workaround for an old teleporting client bug:
  - This workaround broke due to an additional client bug introduced by 1.20, causing players to become frozen to observers when teleported.
  - The original client bug has still not been fixed, meaning a new workaround was needed, but no perfect solution could be found.
  - The new workaround involves broadcasting teleport movements as regular movements, which causes unwanted interpolation between the old and new positions, but otherwise works correctly. This solution is not ideal, but it is the best we can do for now.
  - See issues [#4394](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/issues/4394) and [#5810](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/issues/5810) for more details.
