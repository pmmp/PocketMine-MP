# 5.5.0-BETA1
Released 23rd August 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.10**

This is a minor feature release, including performance improvements, new API methods, and new gameplay features.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## Dependencies
- Updated `pocketmine/math` dependency to [`1.0.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/Math/releases/tag/1.0.0).
- Updated `pocketmine/nbt` dependency to [`1.0.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/NBT/releases/tag/1.0.0).

## Performance
- Some events are now no longer fired if no handlers are registered.
  - This improves performance by avoiding unnecessary object allocations and function calls.
  - Events such as `DataPacketReceiveEvent`, `DataPacketSendEvent` and `PlayerMoveEvent` are optimized away almost completely by this change, offering some much-needed performance gains.
- Significantly improved performance of small moving entities, such as dropped items.
  - This was achieved by a combination of changes, which together improved observed performance with 2000 item entities moving in water by 30-40%.
  - The benefit of this will be most noticeable in SkyBlock servers, where large cactus farms can generate thousands of dropped items.
- `World->getCollisionBoxes()` now uses an improved search method, which reduces the work done by the function by almost 90% for small entities.
  - This improves performance of collision detection for small entities, such as dropped items.

## Gameplay
### General
- Implemented enchanting using an enchanting table (yes, finally!)
  - Thanks to [@S3v3Nice](https://github.com/S3v3Nice) for investing lots of time and effort into developing this.
  - Since this feature is quite complex, it's possible there may be bugs. Please be vigilant and report any issues you find.

### Blocks
- The following new blocks have been implemented:
  - Pink Petals
- Pressure plates are now functional, in the sense that they react when entities stand on them and perform the correct logic.
  - Note that since redstone is not yet implemented, pressure plates do not activate any redstone devices, similar to buttons and levers.
- Signs can now be edited by right-clicking them.
- Signs can now be waxed using a honeycomb, which prevents them from being edited.

### Items
- The following new items have been implemented:
  - Enchanted Book
