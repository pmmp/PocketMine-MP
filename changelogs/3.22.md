**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.17.10**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.22.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.17.10.
- Removed compatibility with earlier versions.

# 3.22.1
- Added a giant yellow startup warning if using OPcache JIT on PHP 8.0. JIT is currently considered highly unstable and not recommended for production use.
- When using a bad PHP binary, the bootstrap will now report the used `php.ini` path. This can be useful for debugging issues with extension loading when the wrong `php.ini` file is loaded for some reason.
- Fixed `start.cmd` causing the wrong `php.ini` to be loaded on Windows when a global PHP installation is used.
- A debug message is now logged containing expected vs. actual XUID of players when an XUID mismatch is detected.
- Improved the documentation for `Player->getUniqueId()`.
- Fixed a mistake in the documentation of `PlayerAuthInputFlags`.
- Fixed incorrect encoding of `NpcDialoguePacket`.
