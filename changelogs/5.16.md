# 5.16.0
Released 13th June 2024.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.0**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.0.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.0.
- Removed support for earlier versions.
- Generated permission docs are now included with every release.
- Crash throttle message (which appears when the server crashed after being up for less than 120 seconds) now shows the server uptime as well as the wait time. This should make it clearer how the wait time is decided.

## Tools
- Added `install-local-protocol.sh` script. This allows installing local copies of protocol dependencies without needing to create releases. Useful for integration testing when doing protocol updates.

## Fixes
- Attacking an entity with a higher damage weapon while it's on attack cooldown from a lower damage weapon (switching) no longer causes additional knockback to the victim.
- Wooden stairs can now be used as fuel in furnaces.
- Fixed incorrect description of the permission `pocketmine.command.save.perform`.
