# 5.13.0
Released 13th March 2024.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.70**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.70.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.70.
- Removed support for earlier versions.
