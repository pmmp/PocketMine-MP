# 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT-1907XX (2019-07-XX)

This major version features substantial changes throughout the core, including significant API changes, new world format support, performance improvements and a network revamp.

## Core
### General
- A new "plugin greylist" feature has been introduced, which allows whitelisting or blacklisting plugins from loading.
- The `/reload` command has been removed.
- The `/effect` command no longer supports numeric IDs - it's now required to use names.
- Remote console (RCON) has been removed. The [RconServer](https://github.com/pmmp/RconServer) plugin is provided as a substitute.
- Spawn protection has been removed. The [BasicSpawnProtection](https://github.com/pmmp/BasicSpawnProtection) plugin is provided as a substitute.
- CTRL+C signal handling has been removed. The [PcntlSignalHandler](https://github.com/pmmp/PcntlSignalHandler) plugin is provided as a substitute.
- Player movement anti-cheat has been removed. Its corresponding `pocketmine.yml` setting `player.anti-cheat.allow-movement-cheats` has been removed.
- The `pocketmine_chunkutils` PHP extension has been dropped.
- New PHP extensions are required by this version:
  - [ds](https://github.com/php-ds/ext-ds)
  - [chunkutils2](https://github.com/pmmp/ext-chunkutils2)

### World handling
#### Functional
- Modern Minecraft Bedrock world formats are now supported.
- Automatic conversion of deprecated world formats is now implemented.
- All formats except `leveldb` have been deprecated. The following world formats will be **automatically converted on load to a new format**:
  - `mcregion`
  - `anvil`
  - `pmanvil`
- 256 build-height is now supported in all worlds (facilitated by automatic conversion).
- Extended blocks are now supported (facilitated by automatic conversion).
- Unsupported world formats no longer causes a crash, but a graceful shutdown instead.
- World corruption no longer causes a crash, but a graceful shutdown instead.

#### Performance
- `leveldb` is now the primary supported world format. It is inherently faster than region-based formats thanks to better design.
- Partial chunk saves (only saving modified subcomponents of chunks) has been implemented. This drastically reduces the amount of data that is usually necessary to write on chunk save, which in turn **drastically reduces the time to complete world saves**. This is possible thanks to the modular design of the `leveldb` world format - this enhancement is not possible with region-based formats.

### Logger revamp
- Many components now have a dedicated logger which automatically adds [prefixes] to their messages.
- Main logger now includes milliseconds in timestamps.

### Network
This version features substantial changes to the network system, improving coherency, reliability and modularity.

#### Minecraft Bedrock packet encryption
- This fixes replay attacks where hackers steal and replay player logins.
- A new setting has been added to `pocketmine.yml`: `network.enable-encryption` which is `true` by default.

#### Packet receive error handling has been overhauled
- Only `BadPacketException` is now caught during packet decode and handling. This requires that all decoding MUST perform proper data error checking.
  - Throwing a `BadPacketException` from decoding will now cause players to be kicked with the message `Packet processing error`.
  - The disconnect message includes a random hex ID to help server owners identify the problems reported by their players.
- Throwing any other exception will now cause a server crash. `Internal server error` has been removed.
- It is now illegal to send a clientbound packet to the server. Doing so will result in the client being kicked with the message `Unexpected non-serverbound packet`.

#### New packet handler system
- Packet handlers have been separated from NetworkSession into a dedicated packet handler structure.
- A network session may have exactly 1 handler at a time, which is mutable and may be replaced at any time. This allows packet handling logic to be broken up into multiple stages:
  - preventing undefined behaviour when sending wrong packets at the wrong time (they'll now be silently dropped)
  - allowing the existence of ephemeral state-specific logic (for example stricter resource packs download checks)
- Packet handlers are now almost entirely absent from `Player` and instead appear in their own dedicated units.
- Almost all game logic that was previously locked up inside packet handlers in `Player` has been extracted into new API methods. See Player API changes for details.

## API
### General
- Most places which previously allowed `callable` now only allow `\Closure`. This is because closures have more consistent behaviour and are more performant.
- `void` and `?nullable` parameter and return types have been applied in many places.
- Everything in the `pocketmine\metadata` namespace and related implementations have been removed.

### Block
- A new `VanillaBlocks` class has been added, which contains static methods for creating any currently-known block type. This should be preferred instead of use of `BlockFactory::get()` where constants were used.
- Blocks now contain their positions instead of extending `Position`. `Block->getPos()` has been added.
- Blocks with IDs >= 256 are now supported.
- Block state and variant metadata have been separated.
  - Variant is considered an extension of ID and is immutable.
  - `Block->setDamage()` has been removed. `Block->readStateFromData()` is now used for state deserialization.
- Tile entities are now created and deleted automatically when `World->setBlock()` is used with a block that requires a tile entity.
- Some tile entities' API has been exposed on their corresponding `Block` classes, with the tile entity classes being deprecated.
- The `pocketmine\tile` namespace has been relocated to `pocketmine\block\tile`.
- `Block->recalculateBoundingBox()` and `Block->recalculateCollisionBoxes()` are now expected to return AABBs relative to `0,0,0` instead of their own position.

  - `Block->isSameType()`: returns whether the block is the same as the parameter, without state information
  - `Block->isFullCube()`
- The following hooks have been added:
  - `Block->onAttack()`: called when a player in survival left-clicks the block to try to start breaking it
  - `Block->onPostPlace()`: called directly after placement in the world, handles things like rail connections and chest pairing
- The following API methods have been renamed:
  - `Block->getDamage()` -> `Block->getMeta()`
  - `Block->onActivate()` -> `Block->onInteract()`
  - `Block->onEntityCollide()` -> `Block->onEntityInside()`

#### Effect
- All `Effect` related classes have been moved to the `pocketmine\entity\effect` namespace.
- Effect functionality embedded in the `Effect` class has been separated out into several classes. The following classes have been added:
  - `AbsorptionEffect`
  - `HealthBoostEffect`
  - `HungerEffect`
  - `InstantDamageEffect`
  - `InstantEffect`
  - `InstantHealthEffect`
  - `InvisibilityEffect`
  - `LevitationEffect`
  - `PoisonEffect`
  - `RegenerationEffect`
  - `SaturationEffect`
  - `SlownessEffect`

  - `Effect::getEffect()` -> `Effect::get()`
  - `Effect::getEffectByName()` -> `Effect::fromString()`
- Static getter methods for all registered enchantment types have been added. `Effect::getEffect(Effect::WHATEVER)` should be replaced by `VanillaEffects::WHATEVER()`.
- All effect registry functionality has been removed from the `Effect` base class and migrated to the `VanillaEffects` class.

#### Removal of runtime entity NBT
- Entities no longer keep their NBT alive at runtime.
  - `Entity->namedtag` has been removed.
  - `Entity->saveNBT()` now returns a newly created `CompoundTag` instead of modifying the previous one in-place.
  - `Entity->initEntity()` now accepts a `CompoundTag` parameter.

#### Entity creation
- Entity class overriding is now explicitly supported, without needing to touch save IDs.
  - Entity classes can be overridden using `EntityFactory::override()`. The provided replacement class **must** be a subclass of the existing class. If the existing class isn't there, an exception will be thrown.
  - Attempting to register an entity to a save ID that is already registered will now cause an exception to be thrown.
- Registering entities will now throw exceptions on error cases instead of returning `false`.
- Entity creation has now been split into two paths:
  - `EntityFactory::create()`: Creates an entity by the given class. This accepts arguments to be passed to the entity constructor. This function is guaranteed to return an entity which is an instanceof the given class.
  - `EntityFactory::createFromData()`: Creates an entity from save data. This may return any `Entity` class or `NULL`. This function is internal and shouldn't be used by plugins.
- It is no longer possible to directly create an entity by save ID. This is discouraged because save IDs are internal and format-dependent.
- The following API methods have been moved:
  - `Entity::registerEntity()` -> `EntityFactory::register()`
  - `Entity::createEntity()` -> `EntityFactory::create()`
  - `Entity::getKnownEntityTypes()` -> `EntityFactory::getKnownTypes()`
  - `Entity::createBaseNBT()` -> `EntityFactory::createBaseNBT()`
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `Entity->getSaveId()`

#### WIP removal of entity network metadata
- All network metadata related constants have been removed from the `Entity` class and moved to the protocol layer. It is intended to remove network metadata from the API entirely, but this has not yet been completed.
  - `Entity::DATA_FLAG_*` constants have been moved to `pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol\types\entity\EntityMetadataFlags`.
  - `Entity::DATA_TYPE_*` constants have been moved to `pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol\types\entity\EntityMetadataTypes`.
  - `Entity::DATA_*` constants have been moved to `pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol\types\entity\EntityMetadataProperties`.
- `DataPropertyManager` has been moved to the `pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol\types\entity` namespace, and as such isn't considered part of the API anymore.
- Introduced internal `Entity` hook `syncNetworkData()`. This function is expected to synchronize entity properties with the entity's network data set.
- Internal usage of network metadata sets to store internal entity properties has been removed. Entities are now expected to use regular class properties and synchronize with the network data set as-asked.
- `Entity->propertyManager` has been renamed to `Entity->networkProperties`.
- `Entity->getDataPropertyManager()` has been renamed to `Entity->getNetworkProperties()`.

### Event
#### Internal event system no longer depends on `Listener`s
- The internal event processing system no longer depends on `Listener` objects. Arbitrary closures can now be used, provided that they satisfy the standard requirements to be a handler.
  - This change improves performance of event handler calling by approximately 15%. This does not include anything plugins are doing.
  - The following classes have been removed:
    - `pocketmine\plugin\EventExecutor`
    - `pocketmine\plugin\MethodEventExecutor`
  - `RegisteredListener->__construct()` now requires `Closure` instead of `Listener, EventExecutor` as the leading parameters.
  - `RegisteredListener->getListener()` has been removed.

#### Default cancelled handling behaviour has changed
- Handler functions will now **not receive cancelled events by default**. This is a **silent BC break**, i.e. it won't raise errors, but it might cause bugs.
- `@ignoreCancelled` is now no longer respected.
- `@handleCancelled` has been added. This allows opting _into_ receiving cancelled events (it's the opposite of `@ignoreCancelled`).

#### `PlayerPreLoginEvent` changes
- The `Player` object no longer exists at this phase of the login. Instead, a `PlayerInfo` object is provided, along with connection information.
- Ban, server-full and whitelist checks are now centralized to `PlayerPreLoginEvent`. It's no longer necessary (or possible) to intercept `PlayerKickEvent` to handle these types of disconnects.
  - Multiple kick reasons may be set to ensure that the player is still removed if there are other reasons for them to be disconnected and one of them is cleared. For example, if a player is banned and the server is full, clearing the ban flag will still cause the player to be disconnected because the server is full.
  - Plugins may set custom kick reasons. Any custom reason has absolute priority.
  - If multiple flags are set, the kick message corresponding to the highest priority reason will be shown. The priority (as of this snapshot) is as follows:
    - Custom (highest priority)
    - Server full
    - Whitelisted
    - Banned
  - The `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_PRIORITY` constant contains a list of kick reason priorities, highest first.
- The following constants have been added:
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_PLUGIN`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_SERVER_FULL`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_SERVER_WHITELISTED`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_BANNED`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_PRIORITY`: ordered list of kick reason priorities, highest first
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->clearAllKickReasons()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->clearKickReason()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getFinalKickMessage()`: the message to be shown to the player with the current reason list in place
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getIp()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getKickReasons()`: returns an array of flags indicating kick reasons, must be empty to allow joining
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getPlayerInfo()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getPort()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->isAllowed()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->isAuthRequired()`: whether XBL authentication will be enforced
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->isKickReasonSet()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->setAuthRequired()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->setKickReason()`
- The following API methods have been changed:
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getKickMessage()` now has the signature `getKickMessage(int $flag) : ?string`
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->setKickMessage()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getPlayer()`

#### Other changes
- Disconnecting players during events no longer crashes the server (although it might cause other side effects).
- `PlayerKickEvent` is no longer fired for disconnects that occur before the player completes the initial login sequence (i.e. completing downloading resource packs).
- Cancellable events must now implement `CancellableTrait` to get the cancellable components needed to satisfy interface requirements.
- `PlayerInteractEvent` is no longer fired when a player activates an item. This fixes the age-old complaint of `PlayerInteractEvent` firing multiple times when interacting once. The following constants have been removed:

  - `PlayerInteractEvent::PHYSICAL`
- The following events have been added:
  - `PlayerItemUseEvent`: player activating their held item, for example to throw it.

- The following events have been removed:
  - `EntityArmorChangeEvent`
  - `EntityInventoryChangeEvent`
  - `EntityLevelChangeEvent` - `EntityTeleportEvent` with world checks should be used instead.
  - `NetworkInterfaceCrashEvent`

  - `PlayerDeathEvent->setXpDropAmount()`
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getPlayer()`
- The following API methods have been moved:
  - `Event->isCancelled()` -> `CancellableTrait->isCancelled()`: this was a stub which threw `BadMethodCallException` if the class didn't implement `Cancellable`; now this is simply not available on non-cancellable events
  - `Event->setCancelled()` -> `CancellableTrait->setCancelled()`
  - `HandlerList::unregisterAll()` -> `HandlerListManager->unregisterAll()`

#### NBT handling
- Serialized NBT byte array caches are no longer stored on itemstacks. These caches were a premature optimization used for network layer serialization and as such were dependent on the network NBT format.
- Internal NBT usage has been marginalized. It's no longer necessary to immediately write changes to NBT. The following hooks have been added:
  - `Item->serializeCompoundTag()`

  - `Achievement`
  - `GameMode`
  - `IPlayer`
  - `OfflinePlayer`
  - `PlayerInfo`

  - `Player::ADVENTURE` - use `GameMode::ADVENTURE()`
  - `Player::SPECTATOR` - use `GameMode::SPECTATOR()`
  - `Player::VIEW` - use `GameMode::SPECTATOR()`
- (almost) all packet handlers have been removed from `Player`. They are now encapsulated within the network layer.

  - `Player->hasFiniteResources()`
  - `Player->interactBlock()`: interact (right click) the target block in the current world
  - `Player->interactEntity()`: interact (right click) the target entity, e.g. to apply a nametag (not implemented yet)
  - `Player->pickBlock()`: picks (mousewheel click) the target block in the current world
  - `Player->releaseHeldItem()`: release the previously activated item, e.g. shooting a bow
  - `Player->selectHotbarSlot()`: select the specified hotbar slot

### Plugin
- API version checks are now more strict. It is no longer legal to declare multiple minimum versions on the same major version. Doing so will now cause the plugin to fail to load with the message `Multiple minimum API versions found for some major versions`.
- `plugin.yml` YAML commands loading is now internalized inside `PluginBase`.
- `PluginManager->registerEvent()` now has a simpler signature: `registerEvent(string $event, \Closure $handler, int $priority, Plugin $plugin, bool $handleCancelled = false)`. The provided closure must accept the specified event class as its only parameter. See [Event API changes](#event) for more details.
- The following classes have been removed:
  - `PluginLogger`
- The following interface requirements have been removed:
  - `Plugin->onEnable()`: this is now internalized inside `PluginBase`
  - `Plugin->onDisable()`: same as above
  - `Plugin->onLoad()`: same as above
  - `Plugin` no longer extends `CommandExecutor`. This means that `Plugin` implementations don't need to implement `onCommand()` anymore.
- The following hook methods have changed visibility:
  - `PluginBase->onEnable()` changed from `public` to `protected`
  - `PluginBase->onDisable()` changed from `public` to `protected`
  - `PluginBase->onLoad()` changed from `public` to `protected`
- The following hook methods have been renamed:
  - `Plugin->setEnabled()` -> `Plugin->onEnableStateChange()`. This change was made to force plugin developers misusing this hook to stop, and to give it a name that better describes what it does.
- The following (deprecated) API methods have been removed:
  - `PluginManager->callEvent()`: use `Event->call()` instead
  - `PluginManager->addPermission()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->getDefaultPermSubscriptions()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->getDefaultPermissions()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->getPermission()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->getPermissionSubscriptions()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->getPermissions()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->recalculatePermissionDefaults()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->removePermission()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->subscribeToDefaultPerms()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->subscribeToPermission()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->unsubscribeFromDefaultPerms()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->unsubscribeFromPermission()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
- It is no longer permitted to throw exceptions from `PluginBase->onEnable()` or `PluginBase->onLoad()`. Doing so will now cause the server to crash.
