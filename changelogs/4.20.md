**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.80**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace are compatible with any previous 4.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

### Interim releases
If you're upgrading from 4.17.x directly to 4.20.x, please also read the following changelogs, as the interim releases contain important changes:

- [4.18.0](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.20.0/changelogs/4.18.md#4180) - major performance improvements, internal network changes, minor API additions
- [4.19.0](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.20.0/changelogs/4.19.md#4190) - minor performance improvements, improved timings system, minor API additions

# 4.20.0
Released 26th April 2023.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.80.
- Removed support for older versions.

## Fixes
- Fixed packet processing error when attempting to use a stonecutter.
- Fixed armor slots containing ghost items when cancelling right-click to equip armor.
- Fixed crash in `HandlerList->getListenersByPriority()` when no listeners are registered at the given priority.

## API
### `pocketmine\block`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public BaseSign->getEditorEntityRuntimeId() : int` - returns the entity runtime ID of the player currently editing this sign, or `null` if none
  - `public BaseSign->setEditorEntityRuntimeId(?int $editorEntityRuntimeId) : $this` - sets the entity runtime ID of the player currently editing this sign

### `pocketmine\player`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public Player->openSignEditor(Vector3 $position) : void` - opens the client-side sign editor GUI for the given position

# 4.20.1
Released 27th April 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed server crash when firing a bow while holding arrows in the offhand slot.

## Internals
- `ItemStackContainerIdTranslator::translate()` now requires an additional `int $slotId` parameter and returns `array{int, int}` (translated window ID, translated slot ID) to be used with `InventoryManager->locateWindowAndSlot()`.
- `InventoryManager->locateWindowAndSlot()` now checks if the translated slot actually exists in the requested inventory, and returns `null` if not. Previously, it would return potentially invalid slot IDs without checking them, potentially leading to crashes.
