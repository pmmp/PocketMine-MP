aliases:
  ##This section allows you to add, remove or remap command aliases.
  ##A single alias can call one or more other commands (or aliases).
  ##Aliases defined here will override any command aliases declared by plugins or PocketMine-MP itself.

  ##To remove an alias, set it to [], like so (note that prefixed aliases like "pocketmine:stop" will remain and can't
  ##be removed):
  #stop: []

  ##Commands are not removed, only their aliases. You can still refer to a command using its full (prefixed)
  ##name, even if all its aliases are overwritten. The full name is usually something like "pocketmine:commandname" or
  ##"pluginname:commandname".
  #abort: [pocketmine:stop]

  ##To add an alias, list the command(s) that it calls:
  #showtheversion: [version]
  #savestop: [save-all, stop]

  ##To invoke another command with arguments, use $1 to pass the first argument, $2 for the second etc:
  #giveadmin: [op $1] ## `giveadmin alex` -> `op alex`
  #kill: [suicide, say "I tried to kill $1"] ## `kill alex` -> `suicide` + `say "I tried to kill alex"`
  #giverandom: [give $1 $2, say "Someone has just received a $2!"] ## `giverandom alex diamond` -> `give alex diamond` + `say "Someone has just received a diamond!"`

  ##To make arguments mandatory (so that the command fails if they are not provided), use $$, e.g. $$1, $$2:
  #makeadmin: [op $$1] ## `makeadmin alex` -> `op alex`, `makeadmin` with no arguments = error

  ##To pass through a range of arguments, put a - (hyphen) after the index:
  #tpalias: [tp $1-] ## `tpalias 256 70 256` -> `tp 256 70 256` - this passes arguments 1 and everything after it to the `tp` command

  ##To change an existing command alias and make it do something else:
  #tp: [suicide]

worlds:
  #These settings will override the generator set in server.properties and allows loading multiple worlds
  #Example:
  #world:
  # seed: 404
  # generator: FLAT
  # preset: 2;bedrock,59xstone,3xdirt,grass;1

plugins:
  #Setting this to true will cause the legacy structure to be used where plugin data is placed inside the --plugins dir.
  #False will place plugin data under plugin_data under --data.
  #This option exists for backwards compatibility with existing installations.
  legacy-data-dir: false
