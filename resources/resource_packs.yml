#This configuration file controls global resources used on your PocketMine-MP server.

#Choose whether players must use your chosen resource packs to join the server.
#NOTE: This will do nothing if there are no resource packs in the stack below.
force_resources: false
resource_stack:
 #Resource packs here are applied from bottom to top. This means that resources in higher packs will override those in lower packs.
 #Entries here must indicate the filename of the resource pack.
 #Example
 # - natural.zip
 # - vanilla.zip
 #If you want to force clients to use vanilla resources, you must place a vanilla resource pack in your resources folder and add it to the stack here.
